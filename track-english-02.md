      <td>India is undergoing unprecedented shift towards urbanization and this change is directly correlated with global warming and climate change. Changes to earth's surface characteristics like ruggedness, albedo surface, moisture content, vegetation covers, and structure affect the mechanism for the exchange of radiation and heat between the atmosphere and the surface directly. All this has prompted the surface temperature to increase which is the major contributor to climatic changes across the globe as per the IPCC reports. The earth's land surface temperature (LST) is changing at an alarming pace, that increases the thermal discomfort. The Temperature emissivity Separation maintains the shape of the emissivity spectrum with the help of ELD (Emissivity Log Difference). The main objective of this research is to retrieve LST using FOSS tools and open data of landsat and to improve/test the TES method and demonstrate the application on Kolkata metropolitan area (KMA) in India.</td>

          <br>Nowadays, the sea level rise is a prominent issue faced due to anthropogenic activities, which leads to the imbalance of oceanic current. This affects the life cycle of the marine organisms and the increase in the amount of carbon dioxide leads to high sea surface temperature. The study proposed the depletion of ice boundary in the southern region of Antarctica. The shoreline change analysis is performed from 1997 to 2020. This research also correlated the sea surface temperature with the depletion of glacial layer by using the linear regression analysis. The result shows the depletion in the glacial surface in proportion with temperature. 
          Key points: Global warming, sea-level rising, ice melting, Shoreline change, Linear Regression.</td>

          <br>Abstract
          <br>Coastal Zone is a fragile & dynamic area where waves, tides and marine currents continuously modify the features in the coastal region. The study is carried out in Puducherry Coastal area, part of Coromandel coast, India which is stretched for approximately 20 Kms. The study aims to predict the shoreline changes and the vulnerable zones of Pondicherry coast. Temporal datasets are used for understanding the evolutional changes of the shoreline and predict the future changes along the coastline. SOI Toposheet (1972), Landsat-5 (1990) and Landsat-8 (2020) are acquired for the study. The shorelines were digitized and transect points were delineated for every 1 Km.  The transect based differences were measured for all the three shorelines (either erosion or accretion ;1972-1990, 1990-2020). The study used Exploratory data analysis to recognize the data sets and condense their principal characteristics, to forecast the shoreline location in 2050. Also, the study assigned index values from 1-5 for Geomorphology, Coastal Slope, Rate of Erosion or Accretion, Rate of Sea level Rise, Mean Wave Height, Mean Tidal Range and then calculated the Coastal Vulnerability Index to classify into 5 classes as very low, low, moderate, high and very high which identifies the most vulnerable zone in the coastal region in the current scenario (2020).

And also due to over population growth, it has negative impacts on the environment. So the urban solid waste management is a global environmental problem in today’s world. The primary reason for urbanization is the rapid Landuse/Land cover (LULC) changes due to urbanization and related concretization. In this study, Land Surface Temperature (LST), NDVI and NDBI maps were prepared to assess the change detection and correlation between LULC and Urban pattern for the years 1997, 2007and 2019 in Trichy City, Tamilnadu, India. According to that, the suitable sites for dumping solid waste were proposed using open GIS software.

      <td>Chlorophyll pigments influence reflectance of leaves and are a key indicator of photosynthesis. There are many traditional methods for estimating chlorophyll most of which involves intense lab analysis and loss of pigments. Non- destructive techniques are best suitable for evaluating photosynthetic pigment concentrations. Among these non-destructive techniques, hyperspectral remote sensing was proven to be one of the best approaches. In this study effectiveness of hyperspectral indices is tested in estimating chlorophyll pigments at leaf and canopy levels for ten species. Pigment Specific Normalised Difference (PSND), Pigment Specific Simple Ratio (PSSR) are the hyperspectral indices used and PSSR showed good results compared to PSND. Effectiveness of indices are tested by comparing the indices of ten species at canopy level whose reflectance is derived from DART. DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) a 3-D Radiative Transfer (RT) model is designed for simulating radiative propagation from visible to TIR in complex, heterogeneous landscapes like forests with atmosphere and topography. DART uses structural and spectral properties of objects for radiation simulations. DART was used for simulating forest canopies and the simulation accuracy of canopy reflectance is tested by other RT models. Using indices ratio between Dart derived canopy and leaf level, self-developed approach Correlational Ratio is developed for deriving canopy reflectance from leaf reflectance, and the same when compared with DART canopy reflectance showed good correlation. The statistical technique CORA (Correlation Ratio) is developed for evaluating canopy reflectance from leaf reflectance.</td>

As the whole world is morphing into a better, easier, and extravagant lifestyle, the environment and the atmosphere one lives in are at stake. India is home to some of the most polluted cities in the entire world. The alarming rising levels of pollutants and the degradation of air quality are mostly because of anthropogenic activities. This year, amidst the devastating Covid-19 pandemic, a rare significant and positive outcome was seen as the nation went into a complete standstill. There was a drastic change in air quality. This study focuses on a comparative study of different parameters used to measure Air Quality Index, before and after the outbreak of corona virus. The result shows a significant drop in the levels of most of the pollutants in many cities across the country, during the pandemic as all the industrial, vehicular, and construction activities were brought to a halt. This invites a discussion if regulation and implementation of certain restrictions can be an effective alternative measure to keep a check on the air quality.

However, when the Covid-19 pandemic shook the entire nation into a standstill, the air quality had improved considerably due to mandatory traffic regulations, shutting down of the industries, inactive transportation, etc. in the last 6 months. The study focuses on the air pollution of India right before the pandemic lockdown and during its various lockdown and unlocks phases in 2020.  Taking into account the several pollutant parameters for 231 monitoring stations all over India, point analyses was carried out after calculating the average for each parameter duringall the phases. This study will help in realizing the drastic difference in the air quality before, during and after the lockdown. It emphasizes on the importance of temporary lockdown of human affairs in the future, for suitable time intervals, and how that will help to mend the environment.

The data like the type of species, position of trees (latitude and longitude), trunk height below the crown, trunk height within the crown, trunk diameter below the crown, crown height, leaf area index (LAI) and crown type are collected from Araku forest. Mainly two assumptions made for the construction of mock forest 1) The surface is Lambertian in nature, 2) Canopy structure of all collected trees are homogeneous. DART simulation editor window is used in software to give inputs. Flux tracking, a default radiative method is selected, and the Analytic method is selected as a method for transferring radiation between Top of Atmosphere (TOA) and Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA). Four spectral bands representing Blue, Green, Red, and near-infrared (NIR) bands at mode R are given as Flux-tracking parameters. Aerial view and terrestrial views of mock forest were created along with images of different bands (red, green and blue) and composites (FCC and TCC). 3D DART model is a very useful method to construct mock forest if we have data about biophysical measurements and the location of trees in a plot.</td>
