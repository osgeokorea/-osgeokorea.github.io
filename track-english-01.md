          Yet, a spatial visualization of electricity usage in India does not currently exist, with planners and researchers having to rely on data contained in tabular form that does not allow inference of spatial patterns. 
          The study aims to jumpstart mapping of electricity consumption in the quickest possible timeframe through geospatial patterns. 
          The research proposes locating the footprint for every state fluctuation in power generation for different energy sources (thermal, nuclear, and hydro power generation). 
          Thus, analysing the grid wise to find the commonly repeated tokens and to arrange them in a hierarchy that can be semantically understood by a lay man. 
          Through this approach, we will extract spatial and temporal changes in power generation patterns (2019-2020). 
          Most of the high-tech states consume more power than estimated which leads to the reduction of power shares in certain regions. 
          This approach has merit and can be scaled up to get rid of the disparity with proper regulations and lay down regular monitoring for future generation with brightness.

         ‘First aid’ is the first and immediate assistance to a person suffering from either a minor, serious illness or injury to preserve life and also prevent from worsening by promoting standby recovery. 
         The current study aims to fix the first aid box at requisite places mainly on accident prone zones and highly densely populated  areas. 
         Geospatially, the site selection analysis is performed where ever the priority and type of services needed for installation of first aid box. 
         The sensor fixed in first aid box could alert and intimate the nearby police control room, hospital, ambulance and municipality offices about the emergency situation .  
         The study suggests the maintenance of first aid box through sanitary workers, corporation staffs or primary health center workers. 
         Also, the research estimates the prices for the basic and advanced first aid box. Based on the incident spots, the type of the first aid box is proposed.  
         The study recommends training to the hospital sub staffs, health department workers, police department, teachers, students to use the first aid kit  to reduce the mortality and morbidity rate.

The year 2020 was no different, even when India was under complete lockdown for a certain period, the number of cyber-crime activities around the country didn’t standstill. This study estimates increase in the number of cyber-crime activities all over India. The crime maps from 2016-18 were generated and analysed. Further, using the data values for the latter period, the number of cyber-crime activities were forecasted by applying Exponential Triple smoothening (ETS) Method for the year 2020.  Although, the results do not show a steep rise in cyber-crime activities across India, but the increase in the number is significant enough to showcase how cybercriminals are taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of people to rely on the virtual world during the pandemic. Also, invariably signifying how far the cyber security in India is from providing a cyberspace free of miscreants.

          Hence, in this study, large volume of analysis ready data of MODIS LST available on open source platform of Google Earth Engine (GEE) has been employed to compute number of HW indicators in Indo-Gangetic Plains of northern India. GEE’s parallel computing power is found to be highly efficient to process large volume of data for analyzing spatio-temporal variability of HW conditions.

    <tr>
      <td>In the last 10 years HydroloGIS developed and published under Free and Open Source licence the application for digital field mapping Geopaparazzi. At the state of the art, Geopaparazzi needed some work to increase its compatibility with other operating systems (it works only on Android devices), to enhance its usability and its look and feel following more recent standards for mobile applications.
          <br>For this reasons, during the 2019 HydroloGIS started the development of a new application: SMASH - Smart Mobile Application for Surveyors Happiness. SMASH (https://www.geopaparazzi.org/smash/index.html) is a multi platform application developed in Flutter to support outdoor activities for non expert users. It is available for Android and iOS devices and has been developed with special focus on a users-oriented GUI following the right material design patterns for the different operating system.  
          <br>SMASH aims to substitute Geopaparazzi in near future. The 1.5.0 release has just been published and includes different functionalities like the possibility to collect georeferenced pictures, notes and GPS tracks logs. SMASH opens directly on the map view where it is possible to navigate local or online raster and vector data. SMASH can already do several things Geopaparazzi can't. In particular SMASH actually supports as local formats: Geopackage, shapefile, tiff+png+jpg with wtf, MBTiles, Mapsforge and GPX, all with a custom CRS and the support for standard SLD style definition. Online supported formats are WMS and TMS and there is a nice service catalog and wizard for adding most common WMS/TMS. 
          <br>SMASH simplifies the data collection and the export of the survey into easy processable data files (GPX, PDF) or through a direct synchronization with the GSS (Geopaparazzi Survey Server).
          <br>Currently SMASH can edit the attributes table of Geopackage vector layers, whereas geometric features editing is coming soon.
          <br>SMASH saves the collected data in a local project file with the same characteristics as Geopaparazzi and perfectly compatible with the old application.
          <br>SMASH represents a big step of an application for digital field mapping toward the usability of non expert users and the user-friendliness. In its last version 1.5.0 it features almost all the capabilities of Geopaparazzi with something more. With the development of the geometric editing it will most probably be able to substitute Geopaparazzi. 
          <br>The application is available on the stores of the specific operating systems.
          <br>In the next future SMASH will then become the main proposal of the HydroloGIS team for the support of outdoor activities. SMASH can be used as the base for more specific personalized applications which can be developed on request.
