      <td>Monitoring urban growth and predicting future scenarios of built up foot print has drawn considerable attention across the globe over last two decades. Researchers have adopted geospatial techniques to quantify, validate and predict urban growth. SLEUTH is one such urban growth model working on the principles of Cellular Automata.  SLEUTH model has been extensively used because of its excellent compatibility, availability of open source files and demo data sets to execute the program. Numerous applications have been reported over different parts of the world to successfully address urban growth planning and management. This workshop offers a unique opportunity to understand, explore and modify source files as per user’s requirement along with hands on training session.</td>

      <td>The difference in land surface temperature (LST) between an urban region and its nearby non–urban region, also known as SUHI, often affect the health and wellbeing of urban population as well as deteriorating the air quality. Along with various spatiotemporal measurement, model simulations are also being used to study the effect of UHI. Envimet is such a 3D simulation software used to observe and monitor the interactions between surface-vegetation-atmosphere, and allows to analyse on a micro-scale perspective based on changing urban character and climatic factors. Envimet has a rising popularity because of its greater accuracy, open source files and user-friendly interface.A large no. of real time situations around the globe have been simulated using Envimet to successfully analyse the issue regarding UHI and find feasible solutions. This workshop aims to deliver an overview through a ppt presentation on the usage and analysis in Envimet to acknowledge the urban heat issue and a hands-on training if no. of attendees exceeds 3.</td>

      Most of the municipalities have their geographic information in CAD format, where it's not easy to have and manage alphanumeric information, and where technicians usually have a lot of different information in a same file, being difficult to manage it because of the file size. 
      At this workshow we will show how to convert this type of layers to a Geographic Information System, adding more information to the new layers. 
      Participants will learn about how to use the main functionalities of a GIS to manage the information of a municipality, for example editing, geoprocessing, or how to connect to the information offered by many of the public administrations through web servers, among other things, using the free and open source software gvSIG Desktop.</td>
