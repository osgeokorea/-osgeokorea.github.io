## <a name="section3"></a>Hints and Tips for a Successful Presentation
  - Creating a Zoom account
  - Test your Zoom connection ahead of time, especially your audio and video
  - Ensure your microphone, headphone or speakerphone is near you. 
  - Mute your Zoom session or phone when not in use.
  - Avoid bright lights and windows behind you. 
  - Good light in front of you (on your face) will provide for a better image.
  - Test any virtual backgrounds that you may be utilizing to ensure there are no video irregularities.

## <a name="section4"></a>Zoom Options for Participants
As a presenter or attendee, when you first connect to a Zoom room to participate in a session, you will be presented with the option to download and use the Zoom client. CLEO Management recommends using this full client version for the best viewing experience. However, we recognize that some organizations may prevent staff members from downloading and using it.

As an alternative, participants can opt to join via a web browser only. If choosing this option, you should use the latest versions of Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge or Safari. Internet Explorer is not supported.

Presenters, please note that the web browser option is only if you are presenting your talk live. If you are using Zoom to record your content in advance, you must use the Zoom client or choose another recording method.
